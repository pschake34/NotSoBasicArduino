## LED_Fade

### Description & Code

This project accomplishes two things - making an LED fade in and out sinusoidally, and visualizing the brightness of the LED in the serial monitor. My 
code contains two main functions: one which controls the variation of the brightness, and another which visualizes the brightness in the serial monitor.

##### Variation of brightness

```C++
void loop() {
  analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
  counter++;
  brightness = offset + amplitude * sin((TWO_PI / length) * counter);   //change brightness for next loop
  visualizeBrightness(brightness);    //visualizes the brightness in the Serial monitor
  delay(150);   //adds delay so the fade happens gradually
}
```

Basically, the counter goes up by one every time through the loop. The counter is then fed into the sine function as the x-value. **offset** and 
**amplitude** are constants which have been set up to constrain the sine wave to the proper values. **length** controls the size of the sine wave 
-- smaller values make the wave smaller, and vise versa.

##### Visualization of brightness

```C++
void visualizeBrightness(int brightness) {
  brightness = brightness / 6;   //make brightness val smaller so the graph isn't huge
  for (int i = 0; i < brightness; i++) {    //print "=" for every point of brightness
    Serial.print("=");
  }
  Serial.println(">");    //makes the graph look slightly better and creates a newline
}
```

The brightness is divided by 6 so that the graph isn't quite so large, then a for loop prints "=" for each point of brightness. At the end, it prints ">",
which also creates a newline so that the next brightness visualization will be a line lower.

### Reflection

This being the first code project, it took me a bit of time to get back in the swing of things. I ran into problems left and right, but I was able to solve
them quickly enough by searching the internet. It took me a while to figure out how to do the sinusoidal fade, but that was mostly due to me thinking that
I could figure it out without looking anything up. After a lot of debugging, I [looked up](https://andrea-toscano.com/fading-led-with-sine-wave/) how to 
do a sinusoidal fade and reverse engineered from there, which, after a short period of head-scratching, brought me to the desired solution.

## Finite_LED_Blinker

### Description & Code

The goal of this project was to make an LED blink *5* times and then turn off, so naturally, I wanted to take this a step furthur. My project flips 
between two LEDs, fading them in and out sinusoidally 4 times with a randomly generated sine wave length. The code for the project built on the LED fade 
code by creating a new function which mostly took over the job of the main loop, and elaborating on the visualizeBrightness function.

##### Controlling the LED blinkCycle

```C++
void blinkCycle(int ledPin, int sineLength, char visualizationChar) {   //goes through one waveCycle with a specified LED
  int counter = 0 - sineLength / 3;    //this counter advances the x-value in the sine wave
  int brightness = 0;
  int cycleCounter = 0;

  while (true) {
    if (cycleCounter >= wavesPerLed) {  //checks to make sure the wavePerLed limit hasn't been reached
      analogWrite(ledPin, 0);
      break;
    } else {
      analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
      counter++;
      brightness = offset + amplitude * sin((TWO_PI / sineLength) * counter);   //change brightness for next loop
      visualizeBrightness(brightness, visualizationChar);    //visualizes the brightness in the Serial monitor
    }

    if ((counter + sineLength / 3) % sineLength == 0) {   //checks if a wave has been completed
      cycleCounter++;
    }

    delay(150);   //adds delay so the fade happens gradually
  }
}
```
This function takes an LED, a sine wave length, and a char to use for visualization, and makes the LED fade the specified amount of times while visualizing
the brightness of the LED. The way that the code checks if one wave has been completed is by checking if the full length of the wave has been reached.
Since the counter which controls the x-values starts at *-1/3* of the length of the wave, the if statement has to compensate for that, because it needs to 
be able to use the true counter value. 

##### Visualization of Brightness

```C++
void visualizeBrightness(int brightness, char visualizationChar) {
  brightness = brightness / 6;   //make brightness val smaller so the graph isn't huge
  for (int i = 0; i < brightness; i++) {    //print the specified char for every point of brightness
    Serial.print(visualizationChar);
  }
  Serial.println(">");    //makes the graph look slightly better and creates a newline
}
```

The visualizeBrightness function is the same as [last time](#visualization-of-brightness), but it adds the ability to specify which char is used to graph 
the function.

### Reflection

This project was very satisfying to finish and watch it work. The only major problem that I ran into was with identifying where the end of one wave was. 
At first, I thought that I could just check for when a wave had reached *0* and advance the cycleCounter that way, but I found that if I got a very
large wave, there might be two *0*'s at the bottom of the wave, which would advance the cycleCounter twice, creating a problem. The second idea I had was
that I could just figure how long a wave was, and then recognize when a wave had been completed that way. This method was helped by the realization that 
my sineLength variable was also the amount of brightness values in one wave. However, this solution also posed its own problem -- when starting the 
counter for the x-values at *0*, the wave would start part of the way through. My solution to this problem, thankfully, was simple. I found that the wave 
would start exactly *1/3* of the way through, so I could just subtract *1/3* of the sineLength from the counter at the start of the loop.
